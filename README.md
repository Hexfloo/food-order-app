# Ecommerce-food-order-app :shopping_cart::bento::motor_scooter:

This React ecommerce page allows users to add and manage items in their cart. Several React hooks and tools were used in this project: useState, useContext, useReducer, useEffect, useRef and portals. <br />
This app is connected to a database: meal items are fetched from Firebase. <br />
I used CSS Modules for each component to ensure CSS classes don't clash.

## features

- Header component with access to user's cart. Item count is updated as items are added.
- Main page with purchasable items.
- Modal to view cart items. Removing and adding items is possible through this modal.

This project was developed as part of Max Schwarzm√ºller's [Udemy React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), with a few adjustments made by me.
